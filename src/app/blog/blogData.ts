        content: `
            <p>Vitamin C is heralded as one of the best anti-aging ingredients on the market and the key to maintaining a smooth, even, and glowy complexion.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. Because of its antioxidant properties, Vitamin C aids in your skin's natural regeneration process, which helps your body repair damaged skin cells.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brightens the skin and reduces hyperpigmentation.</li>
                <li>Boosts collagen production, making skin firmer.</li>

        content: `
            <p>Hyaluronic acid is a sugar molecule that occurs naturally in the skin, and it helps bind water to collagen, trapping it in the skin, so that skin can appear plumper, dewier, and more hydrated.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>The molecule can hold up to 1,000 times its own weight in water. It works as a humectant, meaning it grabs moisture and holds onto it so the skin can absorb it.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides instant and long-lasting hydration.</li>
                <li>Reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>

        content: `
            <p>Retinol, a derivative of Vitamin A, is widely considered the gold standard in anti-aging skincare for its ability to transform skin over time.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Retinol works by increasing the rate of skin cell turnover and stimulating collagen production. It goes deep beneath the outer layer of your skin to neutralize free radicals.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Smooths fine lines and deep wrinkles.</li>

        content: `
            <p>Niacinamide, also known as Vitamin B3, is a versatile ingredient that works well with almost every other skincare component.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>It helps build keratin, a type of protein that keeps your skin firm and healthy. It also helps your skin grow a ceramide (lipid) barrier, which can, in turn, help retain moisture.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimizes pore appearance.</li>

            <p>Salicylic acid is a Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) that is oil-soluble, making it very effective for oily and acne-prone skin.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Unlike AHAs, which are water-soluble and better for surface exfoliation, Salicylic Acid reaches deep into the pores to dissolve the debris that clogs them.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exfoliates dead skin cells.</li>

            <p>Peptides are short chains of amino acids that serve as the building blocks of proteins like collagen, elastin, and keratin in the skin.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Applied topically, peptides act as messengers, signaling the skin to produce more collagen. This "tricks" the skin into thinking it needs to repair itself.</p>
            <h3>What It Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves skin barrier function.</li>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Think of skin cells as bricks and ceramides as the mortar. They hold the skin cells together, forming a protective layer that limits moisture loss and protects against visible damage from pollution and other environmental stressors.</p>
